# Stock Closing Price Predictions using GRU


Context:

This dataset is a playground for fundamental and technical analysis. It is said that 30% of traffic on stocks is already generated by machines, 
can trading be fully automated? If not, there is still a lot to learn from historical data.

Acknowledgements:

Prices were fetched from Yahoo Finance, fundamentals are from Nasdaq Financials, extended by some fields from EDGAR SEC databases.

Goal:

Let us build a model based on GRU to predict the closing price of a stock, say of YAHOO.
